## About me

I am 36 years old. I have been studying frontend technologies since 2020. Unfortunately, there was a long break in studies due to family circumstances. I like learning programming and solving problems. My goal now is to get a strong knowledge of the frontend and learn React and Agular.

I have some experience as an HTML/CSS/JS mentor on the GLO Academy's "WebStart" course. I like to help others with their studies and judging by the feedback from my students, I do it well.
